   XML is derived from "SGML", (HTML is also derived from SGML)

TAG :       Anything between "<" and ">" Angular Brackets
		    The first character in tag name and "<" must not have any space
		    Valid : <h1>, <h1    >
		    Invalid: < h1>
		    Tagnames must not include space
		    Valid: <firstname>, <first-name>
		    Invalid: <first name>

		    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    
XML is heirarchical data. It contains one and only one root.
The root may contain any number of child elements.

CONTENT
1. Schema Using DTD
2. Schema Using XSD
				XSD : Introduced by Microsoft
					  It has alot of better features
					  1. Lots of Data Type (int,bool, string)
					  2. Complex and user defined data type.
					  3. One XML can use more than 1 schema.
					  Namespace:	Document that defines elements and types.
					  Every namespace uses "URI" (Expected: Globally Unique URI)
				
						What if?
							namespace "http://mahendra.com/products" has ONE element "price"
							The FullyQualified name for "price" element:
								"http://mahendra.com/products":price
							For "Using" any element or type from namespace, we instead use a "prefix"
							xmlns:<PREFIX>=<URI>

							xmlns:ms="http://mahendra.com/products"
							Now, i can use "price" element as "ms:price"

						Default Namespace?
							Namespace imported without any prefix is "Default namespace.
							xmlns="http://mahendra.com/products" then "price" element need to PREFIX!!


3. XSLT : XML Stylesheet Template Engine	
		  XSLT = XML + XSL (Style Definition) + XSLT Engine (ex. Web Browser)
		  XSLT Engine is available with Programming language like Java, Python in form of PDF, HTML etc
		   and also with Web Browser in form of HTML
